Extensions and conventions used by RabbitMQ's STOMP adapter
===========================================================

CONNECT
-------

* prefetch: num of messages that be be received without ACK
            (use with ack: client)          OK

SEND
----
* delivery-mode: 2 = persistent  OK
   <- apparently not needed when the queue was subscribed to as NOT
   auto-delete, and durable
* send('x.x', 'first message', :exchange => 'amq.topic') ->
  topic send

SUBSCRIBE
---------
* auto-delete: true/false, whether to delete on disconnect(?)   OK
* durable: true/false: whether to delete on server shutdown(?)  OK

Subscribing to a topic:

* exchange:"amq.topic", routing_key:"x.#"  destination:""
  -> broadcast receiver

  Destination MUST NOT be the same as the routing key (otherwise, behaves as a
  queue). Can use random destinations, must not reuse the same destination for
  diff subscriptions (otherwise ERROR and conn closed by rabbitmq!).

* subscribe('', :id => subid, :exchange => 'amq.topic', :routing_key => "x.#")
  ...
  unsubscribe('', :id => subid)

  -> how to unsubscribe from broadcast
